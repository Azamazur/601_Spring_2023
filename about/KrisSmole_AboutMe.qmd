## Education/Work Background
My undergraduate degree is in Accounting and Finance (double major). Professionally, I worked in public accounting and financial analysis, doing reporting, budgeting, forecasting, and contract modeling.

I pivoted to Higher Education Leadership, completing a Masters in Educational Leadership policy. I am a passionate advocate of underrepresented students, including first generation students, and low-income students.

## R experience
I think I'm up to 8 days of experience as of this posting : ) 

## Research interests
Higher Education topics (including Financial Aid & Student Access), Social Justice Topics

## Hometown
Dedham, Iowa - the 'other' Dedham...named after....you guessed it!  Dedham, MA. I've lived a few places since then, and now I live near South Deerfield, MA.


## Hobbies
Thrifting, antiques, New England history, hiking, music of many genres, museums (art, history, cultural), travel (whenever COVID risk allows) and cooking/baking.

## Fun fact
My last name is of Slovenian origin (Slovenia is near Austria and formerly a part of Yugoslavia). It is pronounced SmO-lee.
