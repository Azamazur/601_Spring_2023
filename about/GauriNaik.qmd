## Education/Work Background
I am a current UMass Amherst senior anthropology major, graduating this year in May 2023. I work as a resident assistant in the dorms at UMass.

## R experience
I have zero R experience! I hope to learn a lot from this class!

## Research interests
I am really interested in using both quantitative and qualitative variables to describe phenomena in clinical anthropology, including demographics, correlations in medical cases, etc.

## Hometown
I come from Dunstable, MA, a small right-to-farm community. Currently my family has six chickens!

## Hobbies
I love to read, knit, drink tea, and dance. I've also started learning crochet and how to draw.

## Fun fact
My favorite fruit is jackfruit1
