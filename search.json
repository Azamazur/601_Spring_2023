The course provides students with an introduction to R and the tidyverse, scientific publishing, and collaboration through GitHub, building a foundation for future coursework. Students also are introduced to general data management and data wrangling skills, with an emphasis on best practice workflows and tidy data management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n     \n     \n       Order By\n       Default\n         \n          Date - Oldest\n        \n         \n          Date - Newest\n        \n         \n          Title\n        \n         \n          Author\n        \n     \n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 9, 2023\n\n\nTech Setup\n\n\nTim Shores\n\n\n\n\nAug 25, 2022\n\n\nChallenge 8 Instructions\n\n\nMeredith Rolfe\n\n\n\n\nAug 24, 2022\n\n\nChallenge 7 Instructions\n\n\nMeredith Rolfe\n\n\n\n\nAug 23, 2022\n\n\nChallenge 6 Instructions\n\n\nMeredith Rolfe\n\n\n\n\nAug 22, 2022\n\n\nChallenge 5 Instructions\n\n\nMeredith Rolfe\n\n\n\n\nAug 18, 2022\n\n\nChallenge 4 Instructions\n\n\nMeredith Rolfe\n\n\n\n\nAug 17, 2022\n\n\nChallenge 3 Instructions\n\n\nMeredith Rolfe\n\n\n\n\nAug 16, 2022\n\n\nChallenge 2 Instructions\n\n\nMeredith Rolfe\n\n\n\n\nAug 15, 2022\n\n\nChallenge 1 Instructions\n\n\nMeredith Rolfe\n\n\n\n\nAug 2, 2022\n\n\nBlog Post Template\n\n\nSidharth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Anticipate the End Result\nThe first step in pivoting the data is to try to come up with a concrete vision of what the end product should look like - that way you will know whether or not your pivoting was successful.\nOne easy way to do this is to think about the dimensions of your current data (tibble, dataframe, or matrix), and then calculate what the dimensions of the pivoted data should be.\nSuppose you have a dataset with \\(n\\) rows and \\(k\\) variables. In our example, 3 of the variables are used to identify a case, so you will be pivoting \\(k-3\\) variables into a longer format where the \\(k-3\\) variable names will move into the names_to variable and the current values in each of those columns will move into the values_to variable. Therefore, we would expect \\(n * (k-3)\\) rows in the pivoted dataframe!\n\nExample: find current and future data dimensions\nLets see if this works with a simple example.\n\n\nCode\ndf<-tibble(country = rep(c(\"Mexico\", \"USA\", \"France\"),2),\n           year = rep(c(1980,1990), 3), \n           trade = rep(c(\"NAFTA\", \"NAFTA\", \"EU\"),2),\n           outgoing = rnorm(6, mean=1000, sd=500),\n           incoming = rlogis(6, location=1000, \n                             scale = 400))\n\n\nError in tibble(country = rep(c(\"Mexico\", \"USA\", \"France\"), 2), year = rep(c(1980, : could not find function \"tibble\"\n\n\nCode\ndf\n\n\nfunction (x, df1, df2, ncp, log = FALSE) \n{\n    if (missing(ncp)) \n        .Call(C_df, x, df1, df2, log)\n    else .Call(C_dnf, x, df1, df2, ncp, log)\n}\n<bytecode: 0x559278333a40>\n<environment: namespace:stats>\n\n\nCode\n#existing rows/cases\nnrow(df)\n\n\nNULL\n\n\nCode\n#existing columns/cases\nncol(df)\n\n\nNULL\n\n\nCode\n#expected rows/cases\nnrow(df) * (ncol(df)-3)\n\n\nnumeric(0)\n\n\nCode\n# expected columns \n3 + 2\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nOr simple example has \\(n = 6\\) rows and \\(k - 3 = 2\\) variables being pivoted, so we expect a new dataframe to have \\(n * 2 = 12\\) rows x \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) columns.\n\n\nChallenge: Describe the final dimensions\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n\nAny additional comments?"

I also spent some time wondering and worrying about the Windows 11 warning. I’m running Windows 11, and I don’t have a simple way to downgrade to Windows 10. I don’t seem to have any problem rendering .qmd files. So, I’m not going to worry about it for now."
