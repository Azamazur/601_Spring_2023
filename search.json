There may initially be a few issues. We hope to have this feature working smoothly soon!"

Last night, after our first class, I took a little time to update RStudio and connect it to my GitHub account.\nI had to do a little housekeeping: first, I removed a space from the directory where I’m saving my 601 R projects, since Erico’s document advised against spaces. I also spent some time wondering and worrying about the Windows 11 warning. I’m running Windows 11, and I don’t have a simple way to downgrade to Windows 10. I don’t seem to have any problem rendering .qmd files. So, I’m not going to worry about it for now."
