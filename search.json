The detective in the series is constantly visiting townsfolk and being served tea or coffee, and I envied the cozy vibe while I listened to the audiobooks at work, so I started paying visits to the office coffee machine."

I also spent some time wondering and worrying about the Windows 11 warning. I’m running Windows 11, and I don’t have a simple way to downgrade to Windows 10. I don’t seem to have any problem rendering .qmd files. So, I’m not going to worry about it for now."
