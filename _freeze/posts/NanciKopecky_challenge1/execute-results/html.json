Then you can read in the data, using either one of the `readr` standard tidy read commands, or a specialized package such as `readxl`. ###Reading in Railroad data I had to set the working directory in order for this code to work.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\nrailroad<-read.csv(file = \"railroad_2012_clean_county.csv\",\n                header=TRUE,\n                sep = \",\"\n                )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in file(file, \"rt\"): cannot open the connection\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAdd any comments or documentation as needed. More challenging data sets may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\nMy comment is that I was able to read in the data after I set the working directory. I selected Session, Set Working Directly, then Choose Directly.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nExploring some commands.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(railroad)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in head(railroad): object 'railroad' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnrow(railroad)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in nrow(railroad): object 'railroad' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nncol(railroad)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ncol(railroad): object 'railroad' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrailroad$total_employees\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'railroad' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(railroad$total_employees)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in mean(railroad$total_employees): object 'railroad' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrailroad %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_employees=mean(total_employees),\n    median_employees=median(total_employees),\n    sd_employees=sd(total_employees))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in summarize(., mean_employees = mean(total_employees), median_employees = median(total_employees), : object 'railroad' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe railroad data has 3 variables (State, County, Total Employees) and 2930 observations. The code below is exploring some commands.\n\nThe mean is 87 employees and the median is 21, wow, there must be some extreme values! And the standard deviation is 284.\n\n### Visualize the Data\n\nI was wondering about the extreme values for the railroad county employees. The box plot shows the outliers and the histogram shows the right tail.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nboxplot(railroad$total_employees)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in boxplot(railroad$total_employees): object 'railroad' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(railroad$total_employees)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in hist(railroad$total_employees): object 'railroad' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
