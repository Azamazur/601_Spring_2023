DO NOT save the dataset(s) to the \\_data folder which stores the dataset(s) for challenges.**\n    -   Render and submit the file to the blog post like a regular challenge.\n\n## Overview of the Final Project {#overview-of-the-final-project}\n\nThe goal is to tell a coherent and focused story with your data, which answers a question (or questions) that a researcher, or current or future employer, might want to have answered. The goal might be to understand a source of covariance, make a recommendation, or understand change over time. We don't expect you to reach a definitive conclusion in this analysis. Still, you are expected to tell a data-driven story using evidence to support the claims you are making on the basis of the exploratory analysis conducted over the past term.\n\nIn this final project, statistical analyses **are not required**, but any students who wish to include these may do so. However, **your primary analysis should center around visualization rather than inferential statistics.** Many scientists only compute statistics after a careful process of exploratory data analysis and data visualization. Statistics are a way to gauge your certainty in your results - **NOT A WAY TO DISCOVER MEANINGFUL DATA PATTERNS**. **Do not run a multiple regression with numerous predictors and report which predictors are significant!!**\n\n## Tasks of Assignment#1 {#Tasks-of-assignment1}\n\nThis assignment is the first component of your final project. Together with the later assignments, it make up a short paper/report. In this assignment, you should introduce a dataset(s) and how you plan to present this dataset(s). This assignment should include the following components:\n\n1.  **A clear description of the dataset(s) that you are using.**\n\n2.  **What \"story\" do you want to present to the audience? In other words, what \"question(s)\" do you like to answer with this dataset(s)?**\n\n3.  **The Plan for Further Analysis and Visualization.**\n\nWe will have a special class meeting on April 12 to review and discuss students' proposed datasets for the final project. **If you want your project being discussed in the class, please submit this assignment before April 12.**-->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Introduction\n  1. The problem I chose to address through my final project is to identify how the credit score is impacted by various socioeconomic factors. Credits refer to the power of borrowing money with a promise of repayment in the future. It supports two main actors in the economy 1) consumers and 2) banks. This ensures rapid progress/advancements in the well being of the people/governments. Credit score refers to a rating or an assessment offered by banks/agencies based on the societal status and analytics on certain economic trends and individual's behavioral patterns. Based on this value banks provide credits which thus shall contribute to the well being of the consumers. Being a new user of the credit card I was curious on how the credit system works and what parameters/attributes have more impact in determining the credit score of an individual. Each row in the datasets contains various attributes such as name, credit_accounts, delays/defaults in loan repayment and so on.\n  \n  2. The questions I will be addressing through this project are:\n      *  What are the parameters that impact the credit score/assessment the most and what are their correlations?\n      *  Which model works best to classify individuals into groups of \"Good\", \"Standard\" and \"Low\"?\n  \n<!--In this part, you should introduce the dataset(s) and your research questions.\n\n1.  Dataset(s) Introduction:\n\n    -   identify the source of the dataset(s): who or which organization collected the dataset(s); some dataset(s) also tells you how and when it was collected ;\n\n    -   a description of the \"cases\" represented by the dataset(s); in other words, what does each row represent?\n\n    -   **Erico's hint:** the website of the dataset(s) usually has a brief introduction of the above information; you can also look for the \"user manual\" document that comes with the dataset(s).\n\n    -   For reference, you can check out[the \"Introduction\" section of this final project](https://dacss.github.io/601_Fall_2022_final_posts/posts/final_project_Guanhua_Tan.html) as an example of dataset(s) introduction.\n\n2.  What questions do you like to answer with this dataset(s)?\n-->\n## Dataset\n\nFor this task I have identified the \"Credit score classification\" dataset on kaggle. The number of available datasets for this task are very small in number and out of those datasets the current choice seemed more promising. \n\n1.    reading the dataset:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- read_csv(\"_data/hotel_bookings.csv\")\nview(data)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 3. The Tentative Plan for Visualization {#the-tentative-plan-for-visualization}\n\n1.  Briefly describe what data analyses (**please the special note on statistics in the next section)** and visualizations you plan to conduct to answer the research questions you proposed above.\n\n2.  Explain why you choose to conduct these specific data analyses and visualizations. In other words, how do such types of statistics or graphs (see [the R Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/)) help you answer specific questions? For example, how can a bivariate visualization reveal the relationship between two variables, or how does a linear graph of variables over time present the pattern of development?\n\n3.  If you plan to conduct specific data analyses and visualizations, describe how do you need to process and prepare the tidy data.\n\n    -   What do you need to do to mutate the datasets (convert date data, create a new variable, pivot the data format, etc.)?\n\n    -   How are you going to deal with the missing data/NAs and outliers? And why do you choose this way to deal with NAs?\n\n4.  (Optional) It is encouraged, **but optional**, to include a coding component of tidy data in this part.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Special Note on the role of statistics {#special-note-on-the-role-of-statistics}\n\nStatistical analyses **are not required**, but any students who wish to include these may do so. However, your primary analysis should center around visualization rather than inferential statistics. Many scientists only compute statistics after a careful process of exploratory data analysis and data visualization. Statistics are a way to gauge your certainty in your results - **NOT A WAY TO DISCOVER MEANINGFUL DATA PATTERNS**. Do not run a multiple regression with numerous predictors and report which predictors are significant!!\n\n**Remember: The goal is to tell a story about the data**. For example, you might identify sports where winning athletes are younger or older than average and then try to see if you can find some sort of pattern that accounts for this difference. Or perhaps you might compare a country's performance to GDP and see if this changes over time. The goal is not to get a significant statistical result but to identify an interesting pattern in the data and then extract some sort of meaningful recommendation or information from it.\n\n## Evaluation {#evaluation}\n\nYou will be evaluated on both the quality of your source code and your written report, with a greater emphasis on the clarity and details of the description of your dataset(s) and your research questions.\n",
