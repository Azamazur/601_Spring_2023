Introduction\n\nCauses of death: Our world in Data\nThe project aims to analyze the causes of death in South Asian countries and in United States.\n\nGeneral Research Question: What are the leading causes of death in South asian countries and in United States.\n\nDataset Description: The causes of death dataset by \"Our World In Data\" offers valuable insights into leading causes of mortality globally and across different countries and time periods. The dataset covers a wide range of causes of death, including both communicable and non-communicable diseases, injuries, and other factors contributing to mortality rates.\n\nUnit of Analysis: Each row of the dataset describes the number of deaths caused by the mentioned disease/reason across the given country during the time period mentioned.\n\n## Part 2. Literature Review\n\n\"Our World in Data\" is a reputable online publication that provides comprehensive and evidence-based information on various global issues, including health, population, and mortality. It is known for its rigorous approach to data collection and analysis. The causes of death dataset likely incorporates data from reputable sources, such as national health agencies, the World Health Organization(WHO), and other reliable databases and research publications.\n\nThe causes of death dataset provided by \"Our World in Data\" can help us gain valuable insights into global moratlity patterns. The dataset allows us to analyze and understand the leading causes of death worldwide. By examining trends over time, we can identify shifts in disease burdens and track progress or challenges in pubic health efforts. \n\nBy knowing the specific causes of death, policymakers and public health professionals can identify priority areas for intervention and allocate resources effectively. The dataset enables cross-country comparisons, highlighting variations in causes of death. This information is valuable for understanding disparities in health outcomes, identifying successful interventions in sppecific regions, and promoting best practices globally.\n\n## Part 3. Dataset Introduction\n\nThe Global Burden of Disease is a major global study on the causes of death and disease published in the medical journal The Lancet. These estimates of the annual number of deaths by cause are shown in \"Our World in Data\". We extract our data from this source.\n\nEach row of the dataset represents the annual number of deaths that happened because of a certain cause in a specific country during a specific year.\n\n## Part 4. Dataset Description\n\nThe dataset contains data for all countries(globally) and has 201762 rows and 6 columns. As we want to conduct our analysis for South Asian countries and for United States, we will extract 2 sub datasets from it.\n\nIndia','Pakistan','Afghanistan','Bangladesh','Bhutan', 'Maldives', 'Sri Lanka', 'Nepal' and considered to be South Asian countries. We see that the South Asian countries dataset has 991 rows and 6 columns. The United States dataset has 990 rows and 6 columns.\n\nThe 6 columns in the dataset represent the following:\n\nCauses name - This represents the cause of death. This can be a disease or a natural phenomena or a legal action\n\nCauses Full Description - This represents if the death is in all age groups or in a particular set of age groups, and weather it is in all the genders or in specific gender\n\nDeath Numbers - This represents the annual number of deaths for specific value of cause, year and country\n\nEntity - This represents the name of the country in which the deaths occurred.\n\nCode - This represents the ISO Code of the country in which deaths occurred\n\nYear - This represents the year in which the deaths occurred.\n\nCoding Component:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\ndeath_dataset <- read_csv(\"NehaJhurani_FinalProjectData/CausesOfDeath.csv\")\n#Dimensions of Global Death Dataset\ndim(death_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 201762      6\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Columns of death dataset\ncolnames(death_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Causes name\"             \"Causes Full Description\"\n[3] \"Death Numbers\"           \"Entity\"                 \n[5] \"Code\"                    \"Year\"                   \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsouth_asian_death_dataset <- death_dataset[death_dataset$Entity== (alist('India','Pakistan','Afghanistan','Bangladesh','Bhutan', 'Maldives', 'Sri Lanka', 'Nepal' )),]\n# Dimensions of South Asian countries death dataset\ndim(south_asian_death_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 991   6\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The number of countries considered as South Asian\nlength(unique(south_asian_death_dataset$Entity))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 8\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Viewing the first few rows of South Asian dataset\nhead(south_asian_death_dataset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"Causes name\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Causes Full Description\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Death Numbers\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"Entity\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Code\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Year\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Fire, heat, and hot substances\",\"2\":\"Deaths -

Analyses Plan\nWe will analyze both the sub datasets created above to answer the following granular questions :\n\n - What are the total number of deaths over the years in South Asian countries?\n \n - Which countries in South Asia have the highest number of deaths?\n \n - Which countries in South Asia have the lowest number of deaths?\n\n - What is most common cause of death in South Asian Countries?\n\n - What has been the trend of few of the most common cause of deaths in South Asian countries?\n\n - What is the total number of deaths in United States over the years?\n\n - What is the most common cause of death in United States?\n\n - What is the trend of the most common cause of death in recent years in United States?\n\n - Which year had the most number of deaths in United States?\n\n - How is the number of deaths related to mental illness over the years in United States?\n\nVisual representations, such as graphs, charts, and diagrams, can simplify complex concepts, patterns, or relationships, making them easier to understand and comprehend. They help us identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in data more easily. We will be using the following types of graph for our project:\n\nBivariate Graphs : They allow us to identify the nature of the relationship between two variables. We can determine if the variables are positively or negatively correlated, or if there is no apparent relationship between them. We will be using these graphs to find the relations between the time-period and the number of deaths across countries and diseases.\n\nHistogram Graphs : Histograms provide a visual representation of the distribution of data, allowing us to observe the shape, center, and spread of the variable. We will be using histograms to represent the most common diseases across countries and the distribution of death over the years in United States\n\n## Part 6.

It can lead to emotional distress, impaired cognitive functioning, and difficulties in maintaining relationships, work, and daily activities. It is a leading cause of disability worldwide and contributes to a substantial burden of disease. By addressing mental health issues, societies can reduce the overall burden of disease and promote healthier communities.\nIt has a significant impact on public health. A lot of causes related to mental illness have been specified in the dataset. We are considering \"Drug use disorders\", \"Alcohol use disorders\" and \"Self-harm\" to analyze the number of deaths due to mental health in United States:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmi_us_dataset <- us_death_dataset[us_death_dataset$'Cause'== (alist(\"Alcohol use disorders\",\"Drug use disorders\",\"Self-harm\")),]\n\nmi_us_dataset%>%\n  group_by(Cause, Year, NumberOfDeaths)%>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = NumberOfDeaths, col = Cause)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth(se = F, span = 1.5) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1990, 2019, 3), minor_breaks = T) + \n  labs(title = \"Number of Deaths due to Mental Illness in United States\",\n       subtitle = \"1990 - 2019\", \n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Deaths\", \n       col = \"Cause\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NehaJhurani_FinalProject_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nWe can see that the number of deaths due to mental illness (all 3 underlying considered causes) has increased over the years.\n\n## Part 7. Conclusion and Discussion\n\nAfter the above analysis, we know that there were approximately 37 million deaths over the years in South Asian Countries. The highest number of deaths were in India and the lowest were in Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The most common cause of death is Cardiovascular diseases. We were also able to see that the number of deaths changed significantly for the years for India but not as much for other countries.\n\nApproximately 71 million people died in united States over the years. The most common cause of death was Cardiovascular which started increasing only after 2010 (It was reducing before that). We also analysed the tren of Neoplasms and could see that the number of deaths increased steeply over the years. The number of deaths are increasing rapidly over the years. As mental health is as important as the physical well being, we analysed the data for it. We could see an increase in death due to mental illness as well over the years.\n\nThis dataset can be used to do an in-depth analyses on the causes of death, like relating obesity rate with cardiovascular disease, etc. This dataset in corelation with other variables can be utilized to investigate the underlying causes of mortality. This will improve our understanding of public health challenges and inform future research directions.\n\n## Part 8.
