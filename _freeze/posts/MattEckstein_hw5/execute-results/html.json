Be sure to anticipate your end result to provide a sanity check, and document your work here.\n\nThis dataset is already tidy as it is.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Nothing needed here\n```\n:::\n\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Converting types A and C to numeric values 1 and 2\ncereal <- mutate(cereal, Type = recode(Type, \"A\" = \"1\", \"C\" = \"2\"))\n\n#Checking variable classes and converting them to numeric to enable calculations\nclass('Sodium')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass('Sugar')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass('Type')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSodium <- as.numeric('Sodium')\nSugar <- as.numeric('Sugar')\nType <- as.numeric('Type')\nclass('Sodium')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass('Sugar')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass('Type')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Univariate Visualizations\n\nI chose to visualize sodium and sugar with histograms because these do a good job of illustrating the distribution of cereals by the amount of each substance they contain. I chose to have 10 bins in each graph because this number provides relatively neat graphs that illustrate that the amount of sodium in cereals clusters around a value just shy of 200 units, while the distribution of the amount of sugar in cereals is relatively uniform\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(cereal)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    Cereal              Sodium          Sugar           Type          \n Length:20          Min.   :  0.0   Min.   : 0.00   Length:20         \n Class :character   1st Qu.:137.5   1st Qu.: 4.00   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Median :180.0   Median : 9.50   Mode  :character  \n                    Mean   :167.0   Mean   : 8.75                     \n                    3rd Qu.:202.5   3rd Qu.:12.50                     \n                    Max.   :340.0   Max.   :18.00                     \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(cereal, aes(Sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](MattEckstein_hw5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(cereal, aes(Sodium)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](MattEckstein_hw5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Bivariate Visualization(s)\n\n\nI chose to make a scatterplot in order to see any relationship between the amount of sodium in a cereal and the amount of sugar in one - there is no apparent strong relationship, it turns out.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(cereal, aes(Sodium, Sugar)) + geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](MattEckstein_hw5_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
