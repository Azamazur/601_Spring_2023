Reports to this system are submitted by the general public to capture information on:\n1) the person exposed\n2) type and dose of vaccine administered\n3) nature and severity of the adverse event.  \nRather than using this data to evaluate associations between vaccines and outcome, I will describe the population submitting reports to this system and evaluate trends in characteristics overtime. To limit biases in this analysis, the study population will be limited to:  \n- Those who received a vaccine in the 5 years prior to the COVID pandemic 2015-2019  \n- Adults age 18+ as of vaccination date  \n- Received influenza vaccination: vaccine has been available consistently throughout   time period where yearly dosage is recommended  \nTrends will be evaluated by the following population characteristics (alone and in combination):  \n- geographic location     \n- age  \n- sex  \n- race/ethnicity  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)\n```\n:::\n",
