I am just starting to play and have found that finding the right racquet to buy is a tricky process, and while there are reviews and suggestions on racquets to buy, it is quite overwhelming. So here, I plan to use the power of data and code to narrow down the racquet options from well over a hundred to just a few that will fit my playing level, game style, and individual requirements for a racquet. The same methodology could be applied to other players by making adjustments for their skill level, experience with other racquets, play style, etc. \n\n## The Data\n\nI am using several different data sets which originated from the website Tennis Warehouse. The data sets are constantly updated, and the versions I have are current as of May 1, 2023. All the data sets contain information on different tennis racquets.\n\nThe first data set is a compilation of reviewer scores for each unique racquet that has been reviewed. Each row in the data set represents a different racquet and reviewer score combination (i.e. every row contains the name of a racquet, a score category, and the reviewer score given for that category). There are several different score variables that correspond to important characteristics of a tennis racquet such as power, control, spin potential, etc. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read in the reviewer scores data set\nreviewer_scores <- read.csv(\"reviewer_scores.csv\", header = T) \n# Look at the head of the data\nhead(reviewer_scores)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"\"],\"name\":[\"_rn_\"],\"type\":[\"\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Category\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Score\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"Racquet\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Overall\",\"2\":\"83\",\"3\":\"Prince Vortex 300\",\"_rn_\":\"1\"},{\"1\":\"Groundstrokes\",\"2\":\"83\",\"3\":\"Prince Vortex 300\",\"_rn_\":\"2\"},{\"1\":\"Volleys\",\"2\":\"82\",\"3\":\"Prince Vortex 300\",\"_rn_\":\"3\"},{\"1\":\"Serves\",\"2\":\"82\",\"3\":\"Prince Vortex 300\",\"_rn_\":\"4\"},{\"1\":\"Returns\",\"2\":\"82\",\"3\":\"Prince Vortex 300\",\"_rn_\":\"5\"},{\"1\":\"Power\",\"2\":\"87\",\"3\":\"Prince Vortex 300\",\"_rn_\":\"6\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Check the dimensions of the data set\ndim(reviewer_scores) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1677    3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe second and third data sets are both compilations of technical specifications for each tennis racquet. They are broken into two data sets because one data set contains measurements that are generated by a specific machine, while the other contains more general specifications that are usually provided by the racquet manufacturer. \n\nThe second data set, which is called the specifications data set contains the racquet name, a racquet specification, and one or two values in each row, depending on the specification. Specifications include values for the length of the racquet, the weight of the racquet, the racquets string pattern, etc.\n\nThe third data set, called the rate data set, is configured similarly to the first two, with each row containing a racquet name and a value for one of the two measurements given by the specific machine used to test for racquet stiffness and swingweight. So in this data set, each unique racquet has two rows of data, one containing the value for its stiffness and the other for its swingweight.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Read in the racquet specs and racquet rates data sets \nracquet_specs <- read.csv(\"racquet_specs.csv\", header = T) \nracquet_rates <- read.csv(\"racquet_rate.csv\", header = T) \n# Check the head of each data set\nhead(racquet_specs) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"\"],\"name\":[\"_rn_\"],\"type\":[\"\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Spec\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Value1\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Value2\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Racquet\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Length\",\"2\":\"27 in\",\"3\":\"69 cm\",\"4\":\"Tecnifibre TF-X1 300\",\"_rn_\":\"1\"},{\"1\":\"Head Size\",\"2\":\"100 in\",\"3\":\"645.16 cm\",\"4\":\"Tecnifibre TF-X1 300\",\"_rn_\":\"2\"},{\"1\":\"Weight\",\"2\":\"11.1 oz\",\"3\":\"315 gm\",\"4\":\"Tecnifibre TF-X1 300\",\"_rn_\":\"3\"},{\"1\":\"Balance Point\",\"2\":\"13 in 33.02 cm\",\"3\":\"4pts HL\",\"4\":\"Tecnifibre TF-X1 300\",\"_rn_\":\"4\"},{\"1\":\"Construction\",\"2\":\"24mm / 24mm / 24mm\",\"3\":\"\",\"4\":\"Tecnifibre TF-X1 300\",\"_rn_\":\"5\"},{\"1\":\"Composition\",\"2\":\"Graphite\",\"3\":\"\",\"4\":\"Tecnifibre TF-X1 300\",\"_rn_\":\"6\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(racquet_rates)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"\"],\"name\":[\"_rn_\"],\"type\":[\"\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Spec\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"Value\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"Racquet\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"Flex Rating\",\"2\":\"71\",\"3\":\"Tecnifibre TF-X1 300\",\"_rn_\":\"1\"},{\"1\":\"Swing Weight\",\"2\":\"323\",\"3\":\"Tecnifibre TF-X1 300\",\"_rn_\":\"2\"},{\"1\":\"Flex Rating\",\"2\":\"58\",\"3\":\"Prince Phantom 100X 305\",\"_rn_\":\"3\"},{\"1\":\"Swing Weight\",\"2\":\"321\",\"3\":\"Prince Phantom 100X 305\",\"_rn_\":\"4\"},{\"1\":\"Flex Rating\",\"2\":\"64\",\"3\":\"Prince Textreme Tour 95\",\"_rn_\":\"5\"},{\"1\":\"Swing Weight\",\"2\":\"325\",\"3\":\"Prince Textreme Tour 95\",\"_rn_\":\"6\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#check the dimensions of the data sets\ndim(racquet_specs) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 917   4\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(racquet_rates)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 262   3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinally, there is a fourth data set that contains the year each racquet was reviewed.

So we need to combine the data sets and only keep the racquets which have every data set. \nFirst though, we also need to restructure the data sets. For the specs data set, I only need the values in column Value1, except for those that correspond to the Balance Point.  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Create a new column that only contains the values I need \nracquet_specs <- racquet_specs %>% \n  mutate(Value = ifelse(Spec == \"Balance Point\", Value2, Value1)) \n#Now remove Value1 and Value2 columns \nracquet_specs <- racquet_specs %>% \n  select(-Value1, -Value2)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow I need to transform the data sets so that each row represents a single unique racquet, except for the racquet year data which is already in an acceptable format \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nracquet_rates <- racquet_rates %>% \n  spread(Spec, Value)\nracquet_specs <- racquet_specs %>% \n  spread(Spec, Value) \nreviewer_scores <- reviewer_scores %>% \n  spread(Category, Score) \n```\n:::\n\n\nNow I need to merge the data sets. I only want to keep racquets in the data set that have been reviewed so I will drop those that don't appear in that data set. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntemp_df <- merge(racquet_specs, racquet_rates, by = \"Racquet\", all = TRUE)  # Merge df1 and df2\ntemp_df2 <- merge(temp_df, racquet_year, by = \"Racquet\", all = TRUE)  # Merge with df3\nracquet_data <- merge(temp_df2, reviewer_scores, by = \"Racquet\") \n```\n:::\n\n\n## Removing racquets based on physical characteristics \n\nThe resulting data frame now contains all the information I need to begin narrowing down my choice for a new racquet. There are many different variables that determine how a racquet plays, and we can explore some of those now, so that the choices I make to narrow down the racquet options make sense. For now, we'll focus on the physical characterisitcs of the racquet and ignore reviewer scores. This is because while some racquets may have high reviewer scores, they would not be ideal for me because they may not be well suited for a beginner player or may not be well suited for my game style.\n\nOne of the most central qualities to how a racquet plays is its head size, wich is a measure of the surface area of the inner hoop of the racquet (where the strings are). Racquets range in head size with most modern racquets falling in between 95 and 100 square inches. A 5 square inch difference may not sound like much, but a 100 square inch frame will be much more powerful and forgiving than a 95 square inch frame, all thing being equal. On the other hand, the 95 square inch frame will provide much more control than the larger head size racquet. Let's take a look at the range of head sizes of racquets in the data set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Remove the text in the head size column so that there are only integer values\nracquet_data$`Head Size` <- as.numeric(gsub(\"[^0-9.]+\", \"\", racquet_data$`Head Size`))\nhead(racquet_data$`Head Size`)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 100 100 100 100 107 100\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a bar chart showing the occurrence of different head sizes in the data set \nggplot(racquet_data, aes(x = `Head Size`)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"steelblue\", na.rm = T) +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\", aes(label = ..count..), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Head Size (sq in)\", y = \"Count\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Occurrences of Different Head Sizes\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Livia_Charles_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs seen in the graph, the 100 square inch and 98 square inch head size are by far the most common head size with few racquets falling below or above 95 and 100 square inches respectively.\n\nSince I'm a beginner, racquets with a head size below 100 square inches are unlikely to be suitable for me and so I will now restrict the dataset to only contain racquets that have a head size greater than or equal to 100.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter the data set to only include racquets with a h ead size equal to or greater than 100\nmy_racquets <- racquet_data %>% \n  filter(`Head Size` >= 100)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext we'll look at another very important characteristic for how a racquet plays: the swingweight. Swingweight is measured in units of kilogram centimeter squared (kg-cm2), but what's really important is that swingweight is essentially a measure of how easy or difficult it is to swing a racquet through the air. A higher swingweight = more power and a lower swingweight = more manuevarability. Beginner players have trouble with higher swingweights and often cannot swing high swingweight racquets with proper form to generate good power and consistency, while more advanced players may feel limited with a racquet that has too low of a swingweight as they won't be able to generate much power and the racquet may feel unstable.\n\nSwingweight is influenced by other features of a racquet, mainly its overall weight and its balance. Generally, a heavier racquet will have a higher swingweight and vice versa but swingweight is also heavily incluenced by balance. Racquets can either be head heavy (more weight is contained in the head of the racquet), head light (more weight is contained in the racquet handle), or evenly balanced (racquet weight evenly distributed between head and handle of the racquet). The more head light a racquet is, the lower its swingweight and vice versa. These days, most racquets are produced to be head light, and within this data set, every single racquet is actually head light or even balanced. Let's look at how swingweights vary based on weight and balance.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#First, check that all racquets are head light so that we don't need to specify whether a racquet is head light or head heavy within a numeric only value \nunique(my_racquets$`Balance Point`)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"4 pts Head Light\"   \"6pts Head Light\"    \"6 pts Head Light\"  \n [4] \"5pts Head Light\"    \"5.5pts Head Light\"  \"4pts Head Light\"   \n [7] \"4pts HL\"            \"3pts Head Light\"    \"7 pts Head Light\"  \n[10] \"7pts Head Light\"    \"Even Balance\"       \"9pts Head Light\"   \n[13] \"8pts Head Light\"    \"9pts HL\"            \"3 pts Head Light\"  \n[16] \"6.08pts Head Light\" \"9 pts Head Light\"   \"7pts HL\"           \n[19] \"5pts HL\"            \"3pts HL\"           \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#There is at least one racquet that is even balance.

As such, I'm going to analyze the spread of swingweights in the dataset and further narrow down my racquet options.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a bar plot with the number of racquets with different swing weights\nggplot(my_racquets, aes(x = `Swing Weight`)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"steelblue\", na.rm = T) +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\", aes(label = ..count..), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Swing Weight\", y = \"Count\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Occurrences of Different Swing Weights\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Livia_Charles_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Compute summary statistics of racquet swingweights \nsummary(my_racquets$`Swing Weight`)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Now we can begin focusing on reviewer scores to further narrow down my choice for a racquet.\n\n## Assessing racquets based on reviewer scores\n\nFirst, let's look at the racquet's overall scores as I don't want to choose a racquet that has an overall poor review.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#First convert Overall column to numeric \nmy_racquets$Overall <- as.numeric(my_racquets$Overall)\n\n#Plot occurrences of different overall scores\nggplot(my_racquets, aes(x = `Overall`)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"steelblue\", na.rm = T) +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\", aes(label = ..count..), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Overall Score\", y = \"Count\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Occurrences of Overall Scores\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Livia_Charles_final_project_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Get summary statistics for the overall scores column\nsummary(my_racquets$Overall)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Other than an overall score, there are 12 other categories that reviewers assigned scores for each racquet. To predict which racquet will best suit my game style, I'll weight the scores of the racquets differently based on how important they are for my game style and what I want out of a racquet.\n\nWithout getting too far into the details of my game style, I've broken the 12 categories into 3 tiers based on how important they are for selecting my racquet. \nTier 1: Power, Control, Touch/Feel, and Groundstrokes\nTier 2: Maneuvarability, Returns, Serves, and Topspin \nTier 3: Comfort, Volleys, Slice, and Stability \nFor Tier 1, I will multiply each score by 1.1, Tier 2 by 1.0, and Tier 3 by 0.9 to produced weighted values for each category.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Mutate the dataframe to reflect the new weighted scoring \nmy_racquets <- my_racquets %>% \n  mutate(Power_weight = Power * 1.1, Control_weight = Control * 1.1, `Touch/Feel_weight` = `Touch/Feel` * 1.1, Groundstrokes_weight = Groundstrokes * 1.1, Maneuverability_weight = Maneuverability, Returns_weight = Returns, Serves_weight = Serves, Topspin_weight = Topspin, Comfort_weight = Comfort * 0.9, Volleys_weight = Volleys * 0.9, Slice_weight = Slice * 0.9, Stability_weight = Stability * 0.9) \n# Create a final overall score column that reflects the weighted reviewer scores\nmy_racquets$Final_Score <- rowSums(my_racquets[, 25:36])/12 \n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have a final overall score that better reflects how a racquet suits my game style, we can pull out the top rated racquets. Since it's always best to try before you buy, I'll pull out the top 4 racquets so that I can try those before making my final purchase. \n\n### Choosing the final racquets\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Make a new data frame with just the top 4 racquets based on the Final_Score column\nfinal_racquets <- my_racquets %>% top_n(n = 4, wt = Final_Score) \n# Print the racquet names\nfinal_racquets$Racquet\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Prince Phantom 100X 305\" \"Prince Phantom Pro 100\" \n[3] \"Wilson Clash 100\"        \"Yonex EZONE 100\"        \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Conclusion and Reflection \nBy using some freely available datasets, I've systematically narrowed down my search for a new tennis racquet from well over 100 to just 4. The marketplace for racquets is overwhelming both for myself and for many other individuals. Using the powerful programming language of R has made my tennis racquet search much easier. While most tennis players are unlikely to go through the steps I've shown here to help them find a new racquet, this code could be altered in a way that allows individuals to answer a series of questions about their game style and racquet preferences and result in having a few racquets suggested to them. \n\nI also created code that shows how certain tennis racquet characteristics are related to one another and how they vary across racquets. There are other features of racquets in the data sets that were not examined here, but could be explored further in future analyses or if this code/data were actually turned into a tool for the use of more individuals. \n\n## Bibliography \n\nTennis Warehouse.
