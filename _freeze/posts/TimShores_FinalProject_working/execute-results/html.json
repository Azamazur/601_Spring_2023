The goal of regionalization, initiated in 2020, is to reduce cost by sharing a service. However, regionalization has made it more challenging for the towns to assess personnel needs of their police and other public safety services. \n\nFor example, if demand for first responders has increased, is it because a single police department is now responding to calls from both towns, or is it for reasons unrelated to regionalization, such as increased police response to medical calls or other calls for which police response is not required?\n\nI intend to use the data collected to better inform budgeting and public safety discussion by public officials in the two towns. Furthermore, the work of regionalized municipal services is a common challenge that small rural towns, strapped for revenue, must consider. Improving how we collect and derive insights from municipal service regionalization data will be a vital service to towns who often don't have the capacity to organize their own data-driven policy and administration.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false}\n\n## Research question\n\n**What is the nature of public safety need behind the increase in calls that police respond to?**\n\n:::\n\n\n### Background\n\nSince 2020, I have volunteered my time as a community organizer and political office-holder in the small rural town of Leverett, Massachusetts. Some of the key challenges of public administration in Leverett are a high property tax rate,   unaffordability, the needs of an aging population, lack of transportation, lack of access to commerce and health service, lack of access to public process, and lack of resources for gathering good evidence for public decision-making.\n\nAt the recent budget meetings in Spring 2023, the Leverett Police Chief made a budget request for a fourth full-time officer position. This position would help the Police Department overcome these problems:\n\n1. Decreased supply of police officer human resources due to state criminal justice reform.\n2. Increased demand for police officer human resources due to increased call volume in the towns of Leverett and Wendell.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n\n## Problem #1 in detail\n\n**How has state reform decreased supply of police officers?**\n\n:::\n\nSince 2021, state POST reform has made it [difficult for local police departments](https://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/central_berkshires/lenox-police-chief-talks-impact-of-new-rules-for-part-time-officers/article_3949b04c-35b2-11ec-8169-a72d6e4669a8.html) to fill their on-duty schedules with reserve police officers. Before 2021, reserve officers required half as much training as full-time officers. Reserve officers could work part-time and as a second job in seasonal positions or on shifts as-needed could do so with lower training requirements. The State of Massachusetts Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Commission has enacted a series of reforms that increased the amount of training required by reserve officers. Reserves must now train as much as full-time officers. This has removed an incentive and reduced the availability of reserve officers. Local police departments now struggle to meet their scheduling needs and turn to requests for more full-time positions.\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n\n## Problem #2 in detail\n\n**How much and why has call volume increased in Leverett and Wendell?**\n\n:::\n\nSince 2020, when the Wendell chief of police retired, the neighboring towns of Leverett and Wendell have agreed to combine their municipal police service. Wendell closed its own police department (WPD), and began to allocate its police budget revenue to the Leverett Police Department (LPD). LPD took responsibility for responding to police and emergency calls from both Leverett and Wendell. This regionalization of municipal service is expected to reduce public safety costs over time, although in the short-term it appears that Leverett has paid for more police expenses compared to Wendell's share. Meanwhile, LPD is still adjusting to the change in demand for police service, which shows up as an increase in call volume that officers respond to.  \n\nTo solve these problems, Leverett Chief of Police Scott Minckler proposed that Leverett hire a fourth full-time officer. \n\nThe request was approved by the Leverett and Wendell Police Services Oversight committee, the Leverett Personnel Board, and the Leverett Finance Committee. When the matter came before the Leverett Selectboard budget meeting, some members of town government and the public wanted to know more detail about the increase in call volume. \n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=false}\n\n## Questions of public interest\n\na. What types of calls are increasing? \nb. What is the change in personnel time needed per call and per type of call?\nc. What days and times of day do we see the most calls or the most change in calls?\nd. Why do we need another officer when the populations and number of properties in the two towns have not grown substantially?\n\n:::\n\nChief Minckler's responses to these questions were informed by his administrative experience, but not by call data analysis. Due to difficulties generating reports from the administrative software used by many emergency response departments, the Chief was not able to use call data to do more than track call volume and call type. The Chief was not able to answer questions about the nature of increased calls: Were they violent crime, domestic violence, interpersonal conflict, fraud, property rights violations, traffic violations, medical emergencies, mental health emergencies, fires? \n\nAlthough people had multiple concerns and interests in the matter, most meeting participants had this basic question in common: \n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false}\n\n## Research question\n\n**What is the nature of public safety need behind the increase in calls that police respond to?**\n\n:::\n\nIn other words, if we hire another police officer, will that meet the public safety need? If our increased needs are by nature medical, mental health, fire, or community health and well-being, then **we risk misallocating public resources in a solution to the wrong problem**.\n\n\n### Dataset Introduction\nTo collect data that could help understand more about the public safety need of Leverett and Wendell, I submitted this [public records request](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-law-about-freedom-of-information-and-public-records):\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## Email to PD: Thu, Mar 30, 2023 at 3:00 PM\n\nSubject: Public Records Request for Leverett PD call data\nTo: Scott D. Minckler <policechief@leverett.ma.us>\n\nHi Chief Minckler,\n\nI also left a voicemail, but thought it would help to send my request by email. I've been learning about the budget requests from last week's meeting to get a sense of the request and the call volume and any other factors behind the request. It would help if I could learn more about our call data. \n\nI'm writing to request public data to do with Leverett and Wendell calls made to dispatch, and calls handled by our police department, for the 5-year period 2018 to 2022 (inclusive of the years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022). I'm requesting complete police department call detail records, with columns of data redacted if they are subject to specific statutory exemption to the MA Public Records Law due to criteria such as victim confidentiality. \n\nPlease export data from your call management software application to CSV or XLSX files, rather than PDF or Word documents. The tabular CSV or XLSX format will facilitate data analysis.  \n\nIf the export files are too large for email attachment, please upload to this Drive location: \n\n*url omitted*\n\nThanks! Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.\n\nTim Shores\n\n:::\n\nChief Minckler called me the following Monday morning to discuss the request. He could supply reports, but not at the level of detail that I requested. I learned more about the challenges of pulling reports. I also learned from Chief Minckler that one reason for the growth of calls in Wendell was that the former police chief of Wendell did not record every call. This was not made known at the time when the two towns negotiated their regionalization agreement. \n\nI spoke with Supervisor Butch Garrity of Shelburne Dispatch, which serves as the 911 dispatcher for most towns in Franklin County, including Leverett and Wendell. The dispatch center and local agencies have used a client-server application called [IMC-Central Square](https://www.centralsquare.com/) since 1997 to manage dispatch calls and responses. The application has a reputation for being difficult to use and limited in functionality.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false}\n\n### IMC-Central Square report limitations\n\n1. The report export format was limited to PDF.\n2. They could only provide call summary data. It was not practical to provide call detail data that would include relevant information (such as call day and time of day, location, demographics of people involved, and details of actions taken by responding officers) because Central Square has no redaction functions. \n:::\n\nThese software limitations have come up before in Leverett. In 2020, the town of Leverett appointed residents to a Social Justice Committee (SJC). While researching a report on policing and the experience of people of color in Leverett, the SJC submitted multiple requests for police call data that included race and ethnicity of people involved in calls. LPD claimed that they were not able to comply because they were unable to generate reports for anything more detailed than than call volume grouped by call reason. The SJC met with someone at Amherst PD, which uses the same software, who offered to meet with LPD about how to generate IMC-Central Square reports. I am not aware of any follow-through on that offer for inter-departmental collaboration on the SJC public records request.\n\nBased on my career experience with numerous database systems, I'm confident that technical means exist to overcome these functional limits. However, I take the claims of the LPD and Shelburne Dispatch to be made in good faith. At the end of the day, it comes down to a lack of resources, and as a researcher I must set my expectations accordingly.\n\nChief Minckler sent me 10 PDF files: one for each town and year, from 2018 to 2022. Each file includes 3 tables:\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## Source report structure\n\n1. **Call Reason Breakdown** shows the number of calls for each call reason, average time per call per call reason, and the type and number of actions taken in response to each call reason.\n2. **Call Action Breakdown** shows summaries of call actions.\n3. **Operator Race and Sex Breakdown** shows demographics of vehicle operators involved in traffic stops and violations.\n:::\n\n**Call Reason Breakdown** is the primary object of this analysis.\n\nI used the R libraries `purrr` and `pdf_tools` to read-in the data to a list of 10 lists of data frames: one data frame for each page, one list for each file, in a collection of 10 files.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprojectFiles <- dir_ls('../posts/TimShores_FinalProject_Data') # creates fs_path vector of each file in that directory\n\nprojectFiles_list <- projectFiles %>%\n  map(pdf_data) # purrr function that applies pdf_data reading function to each file element of fs_path vector\n  # map creates a list of lists of tibbles (a tibble for each page of each pdf)\n\n  # now that I've consumed my files I can str_replace to get town and year info from each filename.\n\nprojectFiles <- projectFiles %>% \n  str_replace('../posts/TimShores_FinalProject_Data/', '') %>%\n  str_replace('.pdf', '') \nnames(projectFiles_list) <- projectFiles\n```\n:::\n\n\nI took the following general steps to parse this list:\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## Data transformation steps\n\n1. Mutated each row with information about the town, year, and source page number.\n2. Flattened the nested list of data frames into a single data frame of all observations that retained the horizontal and vertical arrangement of the tables in the source reports.\n3. When pdf_data reads a file, it parses each text box encoded in the PDF as a separate data frame row. It records x and y coordinates of each text box in a data frame variable. Given the regularity of horizontal and vertical alignment of tables in the Central Square report format, this made it possible to identify column boundaries: each column had a minimum and maximum value for x. I used `pivot_wider` to create new variables to temporarily store values based on their horizontal position on the page.\n4. The Call Reason Breakdown table in the source reports is a combination of call reasons (each call has a single reason) and call actions (each call has 0, 1, or many actions taken by officers). I focused most of my tidying and transformation steps to teasing apart Call Reason Breakdown observations into separate data frames: one for reasons, another for actions. The source data shows time variables in minutes -- I will convert these to hours.\n5. I created a third data frame for operator demographics, although the reports do not show how this data is related to calls.\n6. My code removed all NA values. Every observation in the original reports had values for every variable. However, because the Call Reason Breakdown table format staggers data about call reasons and actions, the initial data frame had many NAs. When plyering apart the semantics of reason and action, I interpret NA to indicate that I must remove the row or fill in the variable with a sub-heading value. The end result is three data frames with no NAs.\n:::\n\nSee my comments in the code block below for details.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  # This next part took a couple days of searching for a tidy solution. \n  # Then I just decided to use a good old-fashioned nested for loop.\n  # The structure of the original documents is that each of 10 files has a variable number of pages.\n  # Therefore, the projectFiles_list structure is a nested list of dataframes: list[[list]][[dataframe]]. \n  # I want to mutate each df with the page number from its PDF, or \"innerpageid\". \n  # Inner pagination corresponds to each dataframe's nested list element index (j in list[[i]][[j]]) which \n  # is information that gets destroyed as soon as I map to an unnested list.
