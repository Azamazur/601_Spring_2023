Data Description

Name: This column contains the name or model of each car. It provides a unique identifier for each vehicle in the dataset, allowing easy reference and identification.

Year: The Year column represents the manufacturing year of each car. It indicates the age or vintage of the vehicle, which is an important factor to consider when evaluating its value and condition.

Selling Price: This column contains the listed selling price of each car. It represents the monetary value at which the owner or seller is offering the vehicle for sale. The selling price can vary depending on factors such as brand reputation, model popularity, condition, mileage, and market demand.

Kilometers Driven: The Kilometers Driven column records the total distance traveled by each car in kilometers. It provides an insight into the usage and wear-and-tear of the vehicle. Generally, higher mileage suggests that the car has been driven more extensively, potentially impacting its value and condition.

Fuel Type: This column specifies the type of fuel used by each car, such as petrol, diesel, or electric. It reflects the energy source that powers the vehicle's engine. Fuel type is an important consideration for buyers, as it affects running costs, environmental impact, and availability of refueling options.

Seller Type: The Seller Type column indicates whether the seller is a dealer or an individual. It helps differentiate between professional car dealerships and private individuals selling their cars. Seller type can influence factors such as negotiation flexibility, warranty options, and overall trustworthiness of the transaction.

Transmission: This column represents the type of transmission system present in each car. It can be either manual or automatic. Manual transmission requires manual shifting of gears, while automatic transmission shifts gears automatically. Transmission type can impact driving experience, convenience, and preferences of potential buyers.

Owner: The Owner column denotes the number of previous owners a car has had. It provides insight into the vehicle's history and ownership stability. Generally, a car with fewer previous owners may be perceived as more desirable and potentially better maintained, which can affect its value.

Why I choose vehicles as my data set

The choice of the "cars" dataset as a data set is likely based on several factors. Firstly, cars are a ubiquitous mode of transportation and play a significant role in our daily lives. The dataset provides an opportunity to explore various aspects of the automotive industry, including car makes, models, attributes, and market trends. Additionally, analyzing car data can be relevant for multiple stakeholders, such as car manufacturers, dealerships, buyers, and policymakers. It allows for studying factors like car popularity, performance metrics, fuel efficiency, pricing, and more. The dataset's comprehensive information and its relevance to real-world scenarios make it an attractive choice for conducting analyses and gaining insights into the automotive domain.

Part - 3 The Tentative Plan for Visualization

I will be plotting different histograms, box plots, scatter plots and linear graphs

Histograms: Histograms are used to display the distribution of a single variable. They are particularly useful for understanding the shape, center, and spread of a dataset. In the context of the car dataset, a histogram can be used to visualize the distribution of variables such as the year of manufacture or the number of doors.

Box Plots: Box plots, also known as box-and-whisker plots, provide a summary of the distribution of a continuous variable. Box plots allow for a quick comparison of multiple groups or variables and provide information about central tendency, variability, and potential outliers. In the car dataset, box plots can be used to compare variables like price or mileage across different car makes or models.

Scatter Plots: Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. They plot individual data points as dots on a graph, with one variable on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. Scatter plots help in understanding the nature and strength of the relationship between variables, such as engine size and horsepower or engine size and fuel efficiency. They can reveal patterns like positive or negative correlation, clusters, or outliers.

Linear Graphs: Linear graphs, also known as line graphs, are used to depict the relationship between two variables over time or a continuous range. They are particularly useful for showing trends, patterns, and changes in variables. Linear graphs can be used to analyze variables like price or mileage over a period of time or based on a specific continuous variable, such as engine size. They help in identifying patterns of development, growth, or decline.

How many cars in the dataset are fuel-efficient or hybrid?

{r} sum(data\$Fuel_Type %in% c("Petrol", "Diesel"))

The above command checks whether each element in the Fuel_Type column of the dataset matches either "Petrol" or "Diesel" using the %in% operator. The resulting logical vector is then summed using the sum() function to get the count of TRUE values, indicating the number of fuel-efficient or hybrid cars in the dataset.

{r} \# Create a subset of data for fuel-efficient and hybrid cars fuel_efficient_cars \<- subset(data, Fuel_Type %in% c("Petrol", "Diesel"))

# Set up colors for the box plot

colors \<- c("violet", "yellow")

# Create the box plot

boxplot(Selling_Price \~ Fuel_Type, data = fuel_efficient_cars, col = colors, xlab = "Fuel Type", ylab = "Selling Price", main = "Selling Price Distribution by Fuel Type")

we first create a subset of data called fuel_efficient_cars by selecting rows where the Fuel_Type is either "Petrol" or "Diesel". We then define a vector of colors (colors) to assign different colors to the box plots. Finally, we use the boxplot() function to create the box plot, specifying the Selling_Price as the dependent variable, Fuel_Type as the grouping variable, and using the col parameter to set the colors. The xlab, ylab, and main parameters are used to label the axes and provide a title for the plot.

What are the most popular car makes and models in the dataset?

{r} \# Count the frequency of each car make and model car_counts \<- table(data\$Car_Name)

# Sort the car counts in descending order

sorted_car_counts \<- sort(car_counts, decreasing = TRUE)

# Get the top 5 most popular car makes and models

top_car_counts \<- head(sorted_car_counts, 5)

# Print the results

top_car_counts

{r} \# Create a bar plot for the top 5 car makes and models barplot(top_car_counts, main = "Top 5 Most Popular Car Makes and Models", xlab = "Car Make and Model", ylab = "Frequency", col = "skyblue", horiz = TRUE)

What is the most common transmission type among the cars?

How does the average price vary across different car makes and models?

Can we predict the price or mileage of a car based on its attributes?
